## :arrow_forward: How to Use
When prompted, the game will ask three questions - width of the grid, height of the grid, and player view distance. 
The width and height of the grid simply specificy the size of the maze. The player view distance shows how far the player, "P", can view. For example, if the view distance is set as 1, all adjacent tiles will be empty but every tile after will be filled with "~" indicating that the tile may or may not contain the exit. 
The player moves by pressing either 0, 1, 2, 3 when prompted by the terminal. The exit is specified with the letter "X".
